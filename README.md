ScriptSync is an app tailored for theater directors and actors.
It gives the possibility to the director to share the script and edit it in real time and it allows the actors to take notes and share them.
It also has a dynamic prompter feature that extrapolates the actor's lines from the pdf and thanks to Speech Recognition and a high performing algorithm is able to autonomously scroll the script to the next line in order to help actors rehearse.
